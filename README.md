# The Remote Product Design Sprint wiki

This is where we're storing all of our internal notes about how our Remote Product Design Sprint works.

We know - things in here are a little scrappy and if you're a non-designer, might be hard to grasp. As we build out and document our way of working better, we'll add much more detail in here.

In the meantime, if you're looking for help running your own remote Product Design Sprint, [send us a message](https://hanno.co/contact)!
